                    At InkRockit we understand that if you want to survive, 
                    you have to rise to the top! So everyone on our dream team

                    to our creative geniuses – is focused on delivering superior customer experiences.
                    We don’t want to be a company that just prints your folders or designs your brochures.
                    We want to climb into the trenches with you, sleeves rolled up,
                    racking our brains and flexing our creative muscle to help you achieve amazing results.

                    Our goal is to foster positive relationships that create loyal fans,

                    This is the way we have run our business from the beginning, and a topic of
                    daily discussion in every department of our company.
                    It is not just marketing hype; it is our culture and our promise.

                        <div style="width: 386px;">Don't let a flawed file ruin your print job! Great printing will only produce great results if the artwork is set up properly. 
                            Images with insufficient resolution or bad color, guidelines that are positioned incorrectly,
                            and missing bleeds are just a few of the issues that will result in a printed piece that is
                            a poor reflection on your business and a waste of money.

                            digital files to determine if everything is technically correct.
                            If we discover any issues, we will give you a complete report so you
                            have the opportunity to fix any problems, or for a reasonable hourly charge, 
                            one of our seasoned production artists will make the necessary revisions for you.
